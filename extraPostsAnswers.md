You can use the `filter()` method to create a new array of posts that don't belong to Jimothy:

```
const newPosts = posts.filter(post => post.userId !== jimothy.id);
```

This will create a new array called `newPosts` that contains all the posts that do not have a `userId` matching Jimothy's `id`. You can then replace the original `posts` array with this new array:

```
posts = newPosts;
```
