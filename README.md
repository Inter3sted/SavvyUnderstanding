# DOM and Array Methods

This repository contains code examples and explanations of the DOM, advanced array methods, and .filter/.map. These topics are important for students learning front-end web development.

## DOM

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. In this repository, you'll find code examples of how to use the DOM to manipulate web pages, such as changing text, adding elements, and removing elements.

## Advanced Array Methods

Arrays are one of the most commonly used data structures in programming. They allow you to store collections of data in a single variable. In JavaScript, there are many built-in array methods that allow you to manipulate arrays in various ways, such as adding or removing elements, sorting elements, and filtering elements. In this repository, you'll find code examples of how to use array methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`, `slice()`, and `.filter()` and `.map()`. These methods are covered in more detail in [this resource](https://github.com/savvy-coders/sc-curriculum/blob/master/Section05/5.2-AdvancedArrayMethods.md).
